# Coding Exam
---

## This is a set of 5 questions that students can answer test their ability to create code to solve simple problems. These questions are taken from actual coding exams done in some companies.

### Question 1
Create a function that check if a year is a leap year or not. Part of the exercise is to research how to compute for leap year.

Specifications:

1. The program should only take in POSITIVE integer values. Include checks for the input values.
2. The program should output using the following format:
    "XXXX is / is not a leap year"

    Ex1. 2004 is a leap year.

    Ex2. 1999 is not a leap year.

    Ex3. 1900 is not a leap year.

    Ex4. 2000 is a leap year.

### Question 2
The modulo operator (%) is used to get the remainder that is left when dividing two numbers.

Ex1: 10 % 2 -> 0

Ex2: 100 % 6 -> 4

Create a function that emulates the operation WITHOUT using the % operator.

Specifications:
1. The function should take in two values and return the remainder
2. The % operator CANNOT be used.

### Question 3
The least common multiple (LCM) is defined as the smallest multiple that two or more numbers have in common.

Ex1. LCM(6, 15) = 30

Ex2. LCM(3, 17) = 51

Create a function that computes for the least common multiple of 2 numbers.

Specifications:
1. The function should take in two positive integer values. 

### Question 4
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same when read forwards and backwards.

Ex1. race car -> a palindrome

Ex2. potato fries -> not a palindrome

Create a function that checks if a word is a palindrome or not.

Specifications:
1. The function should take in a string as input.
2. Spaces and symbols are to be cleaned up / sanitized before checking if the word is a palindrome or not.

### Question 5
Create a function that takes in a number and computes for the sum of all prime numbers from 1 to that number.

Ex1. sumPrime(10) = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17

Ex2. sumPrime(15) = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41

Specifications:
1. The function should take in a positive integer value.
